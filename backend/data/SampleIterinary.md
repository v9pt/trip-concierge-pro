| **Visa for Indians visiting UAE** | Indian passport holders require a tourist / visit visa before travel (unless eligible for visa on arrival).   Usually 3–5 working days processing via online or via airline/visa agent.   Documents required: valid passport (≥6 months validity), passport-size photo, flight tickets, hotel bookings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Travel insurance**           | Must cover health, emergency evacuation, trip cancellation.  Get insurance covering UAE hospitalization, luggage loss, flight delays.  Buy as soon as flights are booked so you cover from departure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Airport Transfers**          | Use pre-booked private transfer (hotel shuttle or car) or reliable ride-sharing / airport taxi.  At arrival (DXB) → hotel, at departure hotel → DXB.  Factor travel time (30–60 min depending on hotel) + buffer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Local transport**            | Use Dubai Metro, local buses, taxis, ride-hailing (Careem, Uber).  Use a Nol card (for metro/bus) or app-based top-up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Time zone & currency**       | Dubai is UTC+4, Bangalore is UTC+5:30.  Currency: UAE Dirham (AED).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
